## Contribution Guide

### Start in development mode

1. Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
2. Set breakpoints in your code inside `src/extension.ts` to debug your extension.
3. From the debug console, you can see the output or errors if any.

### Make 

1. You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.

2. You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

3. `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your extension and command.
  * The sample plugin registers a command and defines its title and command name. With this information VS Code can show the command in the command palette. It doesnâ€™t yet need to load the plugin.

4. `src/extension.ts` - this is the main file where you will provide the implementation of your command.
  * The file exports one function, `activate`, which is called the very first time your extension is activated (in this case by executing the command). Inside the `activate` function we call `registerCommand`.

  * We pass the function containing the implementation of the command as the second parameter to `registerCommand`.
