## Contirbution Guide

### Start in development mode

1. Run `npm install` to install any dependencies.

2. Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.

3. Set breakpoints in your code inside `src/extension.ts` to debug your extension.

4. From the debug console, you can see the output or errors if any.

### Make changes to Frontend

1. Run `npm run rollup` to compile your svelte files into js files present in `out/compiled` dir.

2. Make changes to your svelte code and the js files will be automatically re-compiled.

3. Inorder to view your changes, after starting the extension in development mode, Press (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) to reload the window with the fresh compiled js.

4. To view the dev tools, press `ctrl + shift + p` to open the command palette and run `> Developer: Open Webview Developer tools` to open chrome dev tools.


### Make 

1. You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.

2. You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

3. `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your extension and command.
  * The sample plugin registers a command and defines its title and command name. With this information VS Code can show the command in the command palette. It doesnâ€™t yet need to load the plugin.

4. `src/extension.ts` - this is the main file where you will provide the implementation of your command.
  * The file exports one function, `activate`, which is called the very first time your extension is activated (in this case by executing the command). Inside the `activate` function we call `registerCommand`.

  * We pass the function containing the implementation of the command as the second parameter to `registerCommand`.
